## 1. Introduction

Protein docking is a computational technique used to predict the three-dimensional structure of protein complexes. It plays a crucial role in understanding protein-protein interactions and protein-ligand binding, which are essential for drug discovery and protein engineering.

## 2. Protein-Ligand Docking

### 2.1 Overview

Protein-ligand docking involves predicting the binding mode and affinity between a protein receptor and a small molecule ligand. This process helps in identifying potential drug candidates and understanding the mechanism of action.

### 2.2 Methods

There are several methods used in protein-ligand docking, including:

- **Rigid Docking**: This method assumes that both the protein receptor and the ligand are rigid during the docking process.
- **Flexible Docking**: In this method, both the protein receptor and the ligand are allowed to undergo conformational changes during docking.
- **Scoring Functions**: Scoring functions are used to evaluate the binding affinity between the protein and ligand based on various factors such as shape complementarity, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobicity.

### 2.3 Tools

There are various tools available for protein-ligand docking, including:

- AutoDock
- DOCK
- GOLD
- Vina

## 3. Protein-Protein Docking

### 3.1 Overview

Protein-protein docking involves predicting the interactions between two or more protein molecules. It helps in understanding protein complex formation, protein signaling pathways, and protein-protein interactions in various biological processes.

### 3.2 Methods

Protein-protein docking methods can be categorized into two main approaches:

- **Template-based Docking**: This approach uses known protein complex structures as templates to predict the interactions between the target proteins.
- **Ab Initio Docking**: In this approach, the protein-protein interactions are predicted without relying on known complex structures. It involves sampling and scoring different conformations of the proteins to find the most favorable binding mode.

### 3.3 Tools

There are several tools available for protein-protein docking, including:


- RosettaDock
- lighdock
